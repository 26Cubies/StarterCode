Readme File
========

The README.md file in each repository is a file that explains the nature and purpose of the repository.  A repository can be thought of as a "folder of code" but with the added benefit that it can be shared with others, branched/"forked" by others, and all changes are tracked over time (allowing you to go back and "undo").  If you are the owner of a repository, you can control who gets to see the code (view), who gets to change it (write/edit), and who gets to suggest modifications to it (view and submit 'pull requests').

The README itself is a text file written in a language called "markdown" (.md)  Those of you who are familiar with "markup" languages (such as HTML) will appreciate the humor.  For those who aren't familiar, you can treat the text as simple text or you can add additional special characters to provide formatting clues (text size, underline, bold, etc.)
