Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS).  In essence, Git allows you to take a collection of files (called a *repository* ) and track the changes made to those files over time.  Because it is a distributed system, Git allows multiple users the opportunity to work with files independently, collaboratively, without regard to their physical location.  Version control implies that the history of a file is maintained throughout its lifetime so that users can see where and when changes were made and, if needed, roll back the file to any previous state.


GitHub is an online server where people can browse, share and offer suggested changes to other people's/team's repositories.  I will be using GitHub to distribute *starter code* to you.  You, in exchange, will keep a copy of your written code on the server so that I can have access for grading or for assistance.

Eclipse provides tools for working with Git and GitHub so that managing the version control process is as painless as possible.  At school, of course, our network security system is designed to prevent using the network protocols that make working with Git such a pleasure but there are workarounds.  At home, you will almost surely come to appreciate the ease with which you can upload and download copies of code (your own and others).
