Overview
======
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS).  In essence, Git allows you to take a collection of files (called a *repository* ) and track the changes made to those files over time.  Because it is a distributed system, Git allows multiple users the opportunity to work with files independently, collaboratively, without regard to their physical location.  Version control implies that the history of a file is maintained throughout its lifetime so that users can see where and when changes were made and, if needed, roll back the file to any previous state.


GitHub is an online server where people can browse, share and offer suggested changes to other people's/team's repositories.  I will be using GitHub to distribute *starter code* to you.  You, in exchange, will keep a copy of your written code on the server so that I can have access for grading or for assistance.

Eclipse provides tools for working with Git and GitHub so that managing the version control process is as painless as possible.  At school, of course, our network security system is designed to prevent using the network protocols that make working with Git such a pleasure but there are workarounds.  At home, you will almost surely come to appreciate the ease with which you can upload and download copies of code (your own and others).

Gitting Started
======
Three ways to start (the first two are standard; the third, the one we will use):

1. Take an existing folder of files on your hard drive and turn them into a Git repository.  Typically, you would want to install the Git software for your operating system and then use the "git init" command inside that folder. 
2. Clone someone else's existing repository.  For example, you might visit GitHub and find a project that interests you and click the link to download a cloned copy to your Desktop.
3. I've created a repository for you at GitHub.  If you log in, you will find that if your name is __Ima Student__, you now belong to a team (unique to you) called __Team Ima__.  You and I are the only members of that team.  Our team has access to a *repository* called __student.ima__.  This repository is where you should begin putting your code (*.java files, only).  Because you and I belong to the same team, I will be able to view the files you upload here.  Otherwise, the repository is __private__, so others will not have access.  

Understanding How Git Works and What You're Doing
======
Excellent online book about Git <a href = "http://git-scm.com/book"> here </a>.  Note: although I recommend you browse through Chapter Two for a background glimpse into Git, this book is not specifically about using GitHub.

The free tutorials <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real"> here </a> and <a href="http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1"> here </a> at Code School are also NOT about GitHub but about working with Git through the command line prompt.  Still, if you have 15 min. it will give you a feel for what Eclipse and other team tools can do semi-automatically for you.
